# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Analysis
This project will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries. 

# Conclusions: 

The project was also able to answer the following questions:
* How has the GDP trended over time in the six nations?
     * All six countries have had fairly steady growth of GDP over this timeframe. China and the United States have had the most steady growth over this timeframe. Zimbabwe has seen exponential growth in GDP around 2008 after seeing GDP decrease every year from 2000-2008. Mexico had a steady progression until around 2009 where a drastic decrease in GDP occured. In 2010, the GDP continued to progress normally. 
     
* How has life expectancy trended over time in the six nations?
    * All six countries have had fairly steady growth of Life Expectancy over this timeframe. When comparing all six countries on the same lineplot, Zimbabwe has had the greatest growth in life expectancy, with significant growth over the span of 2006-2015. 

* Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
    * Yes there is a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy. This is represented by the plots of life expectancy vs. GDP where most trends are positive with a mostly linear relationship. 

* What is the distribution of the GDP and life expectancy?
    * Distribution of the GDP was mostly skewed right with a majority of the data points being represented towards the left portion of the graph. The distribution of life expectancy was the exact opposite with a left skew and data mostly represented on the right side of the graph.
